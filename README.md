# Oyster Spat Project
## References

## Introduction 
The goal of the project was to identify what water conditions are ideal for the settlement and growth of juvenile oysters (referred to as spat). 
With the specific application asking whether certain canal docks would be viable for growing oysters for the
sake of restoring oyster reefs. This can be aided by utilizing old oyster shells as
a base or substrate for new oysters to attach to. Oyster reefs provide important
ecosystem services, such as water filtration and habitat for many organisms.
Unfortunately, they are in decline globally. The specific variables related to
water conditions that were focused on based on prior research indicating their
importance in oyster development include
* Temperature
* Salinity 
* % Dissolved Oxygen 
* Chlorophyll
## Planned Figures
I would like to produce a series of dot plots illustrating each aspect of water
conditionâ€™s relationship with both the settlement and growth rate of the oysters.
If possible I would be interested in also running some form of statistical test to
determine whether any trends are statistically significant, given that the data
set is somewhat limited.
## Methods
The experiment was run with the assistance of ten dock owners
who allowed us to utilize their property as sites. For each site, three strings
consisting of 30 old oyster shells were constructed and hung off the side of the
property into a canal. Every two weeks, the water at each site was tested and
the strings collected. After collection, we counted and measured the diameter of
each young oyster on each string and then returned them to the sites. All data
was recorded in a series of excel documents.
## Steps Going Forward
* To begin with I will likely need to reorganize the collected data. The way
everything was collected does not line up with how it should be processed.
* I will have to do some research into statistical tests, in order to determine
how I should approach them for this project.
* Begin graphing the reorganized data





I am having trouble getting everything from my fastX browser to send over to git.
